About Patmos
============

Patmos is a time-predictable VLIW processor. Patmos is the processor for the T-CREST project.

The Patmos [Handbook]
(https://github.com/t-crest/patmos/blob/master/doc/patmos_handbook.pdf?raw=true)
is work in progress, but contains build instructions in Section 5.

Getting Started
===============

Several packages need to be installed.
The following apt-get lists the packages that need to be
installed:

    sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk git cmake make g++ texinfo flex bison \
      libelf-dev graphviz libboost-dev libboost-program-options-dev ruby1.9.1 \
      gtkwave

We assume that the T-CREST project will live in $HOME/t-crest.
Patmos and the compiler can be checked out from GitHub and built as follows:

    mkdir ~/t-crest
    cd ~/t-crest
    git clone https://github.com/t-crest/patmos-misc.git misc
    ./misc/build.sh

For developers with push permission ssh based clone string is then:

    git clone git@github.com:t-crest/patmos-misc.git misc

build.sh will checkout several other repositories (the compiler, library,
the Patmos source, and benchmarks) and
build the compiler, the Patmos simulator, and the test benches.
Therefore, take a cup of coffee and find some nice reading.
After building the compiler add the path
to the compiler executables into your .profile:

    export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/t-crest/local/bin

Use an absolute path as LLVM cannot handle a path relative to the
home directory (~).

One might start with the standard, harmless looking Hello World:

    main() {
        printf("Hello Patmos!\n");
    }

With the compiler installed it can be compiled to a Patmos executable
and run with the simulator as follows:

    patmos-clang hell.c
    pasim a.out

However, this innocent examples is quiet challenging for an embedded system.
