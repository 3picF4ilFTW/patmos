Patmos coding style
===================

Scala is very flexible relative to file names and directory structure.
However, within the Patmos project we intend to adhere to the common
Java/Scala coding style.

Symbols, names are written in CamelCase. No C style _ are used.

Types (classes) start with an upper case character. Class members
(fields, methods), functions, and local variables start with a lower
case character. Constants are written all upper case.

Indentation is two spaces.

File names have the name of the (main) class. Helper classes can
be in the same file. Packages are organized in the Java style,
where the directories represent the package hierarchy.

It is important in HW design to quickly distinguish between combinational
circuits and registers. Therefore, all registers shall end with Reg
(e.g., cntReg).
