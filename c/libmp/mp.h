 * \brief Message passing library for the T-CREST platform
 *
 * It is up to the programmer to allocate buffering space in the communication
 * scratch pads. The allocation is done by calling the function mp_chan_init().
 *
 * The size of the message passing buffer structure in the commuincation
 * scratch pads are:
 *
 * Sender side:
 *       2 * (buf_size + FLAG_SIZE) + sizeof(recv_count)(Aligned to DW)
 *
 * Receiver side:
 *       num_buf * (buf_size + FLAG_SIZE) + sizeof(remote_recv_count)
 *                                                       (Aligned to DW)
