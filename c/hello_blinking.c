/*
	This is the first C based program executed on the FPGA version
	of Patmos. A carefully written embedded hello world program.

	The following is not true anymore. Why?
	Additional to the blinking LED we write to the UART '0' and '1' (if available).

	TODO: IO is defined via ld/st local, but the compiler generates
	a different ld/st type here. We currently accept all ld/st types
	for IO in the HW (not in pasim).
	MS: the above is fixed by the _SPM, I assume.
