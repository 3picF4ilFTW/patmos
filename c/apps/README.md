# Appliations for Patmos and T-CREST

Small example programs (single file) live in folder c.
Larger applications shall live in their own folder under
apps and provide their own Makefile for a build.

Future changes: this Makefile shall be invoked from the
main Makefile in patmos and there shall be a naming and
copying convention for the resulting .elf file for the
download form that Makefile.
